# Na-ve-Bees-Predict-Species-from-Images
 
This is a premium project from DataCamp that I have completed. Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow me to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, I will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data, then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.
